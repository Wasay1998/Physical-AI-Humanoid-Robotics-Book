# Capstone Humanoid Robotics Project

## Project Goal
Design, simulate, and potentially implement a solution for a real-world problem using the knowledge gained from this textbook. This project will integrate concepts from ROS 2, simulation environments (Gazebo/Unity/Isaac Sim), and potentially AI/VLA systems to create a functional robotic application.

## Potential Project Ideas (Choose one or propose your own)

1.  **Autonomous Navigation for a Mobile Robot:** Implement a ROS 2-based navigation stack for a mobile robot in a simulated environment. The robot should be able to map its environment, localize itself within the map, and navigate to specified waypoints while avoiding obstacles.
2.  **Robotic Arm Manipulation for Assembly:** Design a control system for a simulated robotic arm to perform a pick-and-place task, such as assembling a simple product from multiple components. This could involve using inverse kinematics, motion planning, and object recognition.
3.  **Humanoid Robot Interaction with a VLA System:** Develop a system where a simulated humanoid robot can respond to natural language commands (e.g., "bring me the water bottle") by using computer vision to identify objects and robotic manipulation to interact with them.
4.  **Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control:** Train a reinforcement learning agent to control a simulated robot (e.g., a quadruped robot or a drone) to perform a complex locomotion or manipulation task.

## Project Deliverables

-   **Project Proposal:** A brief document outlining your chosen project, its objectives, the technologies you plan to use, and a high-level implementation plan.
-   **Codebase:** A well-structured and documented codebase for your robotic application.
-   **Demonstration:** A video or live demonstration of your simulated robot performing the chosen task.
-   **Project Report:** A comprehensive report detailing your design choices, implementation challenges, results, and future work.

# Lesson 2.3: ROS 2 and Unity Integration

## Objectives
- Learn how to connect ROS 2 with a Unity simulation.
- Send and receive messages between ROS 2 nodes and Unity.

## Concept Summary
Unity Robotics packages enable seamless integration with ROS 2.

## Real-World Context
This integration allows for advanced robot simulation and testing with rich visual environments.

<h2>Activity: ROS 2 - Unity Communication</h2>
Set up basic communication between a ROS 2 publisher/subscriber and a Unity script.

## Technical Notes
- The ROS-Unity bridge is essential for this communication.

## Practice Task
Control a Unity robot's movement using ROS 2 messages.

## Reflection
- How can this integration be used for training AI models?

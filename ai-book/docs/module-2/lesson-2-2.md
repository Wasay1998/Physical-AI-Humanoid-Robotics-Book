# Lesson 2.2: Integrating Unity with Robotics

## Objectives
- Understand how Unity can be used for robotics simulation.
- Learn to set up a basic Unity project for robot control.

## Concept Summary
Unity is a powerful game engine that can be adapted for robotics simulation and visualization.

## Real-World Context
Unity provides high-fidelity graphics and advanced physics, making it suitable for complex robot environments.

<h2>Activity: Basic Unity Robot Setup</h2>
Set up a new Unity project and import a simple robot model. Configure basic physics.

## Technical Notes
- Unity ML-Agents can be used for training robot control policies.

## Practice Task
Make the robot move using simple scripts.

## Reflection
- Compare the strengths of Gazebo vs. Unity for robotics simulation.

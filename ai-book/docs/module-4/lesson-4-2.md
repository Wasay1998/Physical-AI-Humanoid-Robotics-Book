# Lesson 4.2: Designing VLA Architectures

## Objectives
- Learn different architectural patterns for VLA systems.
- Understand the trade-offs between centralized and modular designs.

## Concept Summary
VLA architectures involve integrating multiple AI components, each specializing in vision, language, or action.

## Real-World Context
Designing effective VLA architectures is crucial for creating adaptable and robust robotic systems that can operate in unstructured environments.

<h2>Activity: Design a VLA System for a Home Assistant Robot</h2>
Given a scenario (e.g., a robot tidying a living room), design a VLA architecture, specifying the components and their interactions.

## Technical Notes
- Consider data flow, computational requirements, and real-time constraints.

## Practice Task
Research a published VLA architecture and identify its strengths and weaknesses.

## Reflection
- What are the key considerations when choosing between a tightly coupled or loosely coupled VLA architecture?

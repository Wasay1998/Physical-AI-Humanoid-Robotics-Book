# Lesson 3.3: AI and Reinforcement Learning in Isaac Sim

## Objectives
- Understand how to integrate AI and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Isaac Sim.
- Train a simple RL agent to control a robot.

## Concept Summary
Isaac Sim is a prime platform for training RL agents for robotics tasks.

## Real-World Context
RL is a powerful paradigm for teaching robots complex behaviors through trial and error.

<h2>Activity: Train a Simple RL Agent</h2>
Use a provided example to train an RL agent to perform a basic task in Isaac Sim.

## Technical Notes
- Isaac Gym and Isaac Orbit are related tools for large-scale RL training.

## Practice Task
Modify the RL agent's reward function to achieve a different behavior.

## Reflection
- What are the challenges in designing effective reward functions for RL agents?

# Lesson 1.2: Understanding ROS 2 Services

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of services in ROS 2.
- Create a service server and client.

## Concept Summary
Services are a request/response communication method in ROS 2.

## Real-World Context
Services are used for actions that need a confirmation, like telling a robot to move to a specific location.

## Activity
Create a service that adds two integers.

## Technical Notes
- Services have a `.srv` file that defines the request and response.

## Practice Task
Modify the service to subtract two integers.

## Reflection
- When would you use a service instead of a topic?

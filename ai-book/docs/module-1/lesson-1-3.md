# Lesson 1.3: Understanding ROS 2 Actions

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of actions in ROS 2.
- Create an action server and client.

## Concept Summary
Actions are for long-running tasks that provide feedback.

## Real-World Context
Actions are used for tasks like navigation, where you want to know the progress.

## Activity
Create an action that counts to 10.

## Technical Notes
- Actions have a `.action` file that defines the goal, result, and feedback.

## Practice Task
Modify the action to count down from 10.

## Reflection
- When would you use an action instead of a service or a topic?
